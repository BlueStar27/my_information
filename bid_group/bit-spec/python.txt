------python & Django & vue-------

Dear client,
Thank you for your job post.
I can help with upcoming challenges because I have succeeded at building several websites using Vue and Django Framework and tools(ex: Selenium, Rest API, Flask, Redis, Elastic Search ...).
I have 7+ years of experience in Python, Django and Vue and
- Created multiple web apps from scratch, starting from the requirements gathering to the application design and development, always using Django and Flask as my primary stack.
- Integrated several database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, NoSQL DB) and workers(redis, elasticsearch).

Additionally, my teamwork is great and I adapt to new environment so fast and get along with other team members.

If you award me, I'd be very happy to discuss this further and get started for you immediately.
It would be great if we can schedule a meeting soon to discuss the project.
