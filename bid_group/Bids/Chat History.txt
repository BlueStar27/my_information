hello
Hi, thanks very much for your reply
----
nice to meet you
Nice to meet you too.
----
my project is very simple
I see
we are launching our erc20 token (NPT will be the name)
and need a website where the user can do the following things:
1. deposit EUR with credit card or bank transfer
2. buy NPT by using the EUR deposited
3. withdraw NPT to move them to another wallet
4. deposit NPT
5. sell NPT and collect EUR on their account
----
6. withdraw EUR by bank transfer
Is that all?
So have you already created your NPT token?
by the way there will be kyc for users, 2fa authentication with google AUTH, transaction history etc
----
we are writing the NPT smart contract right now
Got it
----
i can share some screens to better show what i need
Please
Share
this is the internal wallet...by the way there will be NPT and EUR
----

Just checked
a form like this one will allow to buy/sell NPT

there will be a dashboard and user will set his parameters by a page like this one

the script will have a support page and will be it/en
you will use a template with some pages included

----
yes
Only frontend?
----
no, frontend and backend by the way
What's your prefer ?
Just checked
----
don't get you
no, I mean there are many pages there
We might be using pages needed
right?
yes but we will use the page that we need as the login/signup/lost pwd, user details and their UI components
----
we told the same
Ok
no problem
----
tell me your idea
Do you have entire design?
----
no
or mockup?
Then according to my eye?

https://demo3.coinsclone.com/
https://demo3.coinsclone.com/workarea
the 2nd is the admin backend
----
but if you want i can create amockup for you
first is user dashboard
user backend
yes
the admin will have ony the features that we need
----
only
you already said me "we are writing the NPT smart contract right now"
you mean someone is developing NPT smart contract?
----
no, i'm doing by myself
Oh, great

erc20_Neptune.sol

Ok
Please send me the doc details

I think now I can say my rough estimate
But you need to know exactly estimate
maybe
So after you send me the doc
----
tell me your rough
Ok
----
so we will consider if there are opportunities to go on
Let me think
User backend: 1000
Admin backend: 2000
Totally 3K
How about this?
it's very expensive
----
totally out of my budget
This is not absolute
----
but it is very far
Your estimate?
----
it is very far
I have to develop smart contract with you also
Please let me know your estimate
i can't spend more than 1500$
----
but i have lot of offers around this budget
Ok
I'll always do my best for client
Of course, include you
Would you like git repo?
----
i will share the mockup soon and you will tell me

3-4 weeks

Hi
Are you having a good Weekends?
Yes sure
I have fully completed my user mockup
----
And almost finished the admin mockup
Hi,
Good news
Hi
----
Are you working on Sunday?
a little
----
slightly smiling face emoji
Checking the link you sent, I have some questions
----
Pls tell
The template is powered by angular
So we should be using Angular for our dApp?
----
It should be only bootstrap
So did you buy the theme?
It's only for reference template
?
----
No problem... Haven't bought extendef license yet
How about making just like theme?
----
It can be a solution... The point is the responsiveness
yeah
responsive dApp
I prefer React
React is better than Angular
I mean it's js framework
----
No problem.. But the template is html and bootstrap, no Angular
Ok
There is the stack when I check the template
Technology: Bootstrap, Angular...
so..
----
I will send you the admin mockup soon... Hope you will finalize offer and deadline
Sure
----
And copy of template
I already created a private git repo for this
I need to send you the invitation
----
Ok
?
----
Send me
How ?
----
Ok do you need my git access
I don't know your info
----
I'm not on my pc, need 30min
I mean you have to send me the mail so that I can give you the access
Ok
----
Eziogrieco75@gmail.com
Just sent
----
Ok
Which server would you like to use to deploy app so that you can check?
----
We will decide together acclrsing with your requirements
If you can install the codebase on your pc, it should be no problem
via git repo
----
It's up to you
I'll report daily and you can see the progress
----
By the way i would need of a place where to do testing
Do you have AWS account?
----
No, but i could open
you can test it on your pc or we can use AWS
----
Better to use aws i think
Of course, according to my help
smiley emoji
----
üëçüèª
Let me deploy it on AWS
----
Ok
I know well for this
----
But we should fix budget and deadline before
Alright
After I check the mockup you made
----
Ok, give me 2/3 hours to complete it
Take your time
