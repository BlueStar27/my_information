Hello Thanks for your kind care. I've just checked your requirements carefully.
As a Full Stack developer who has 6+ years of experiences in Programming, I have much experiences in Blockchain Technology and full stack development I'm very familiar with Solidity, Ethereum, Solana, BSC, ERC1155, Smart Contract and Pixel Perfect Web Design, React.js React Native, Redux.js, NodeJS, Express.js, AWS and so on.
I have already published some blockchain tokens and it is being used now. So we can discuss more detail in the chat about your project.
Always I write the clean code so that anyone can check and understand my codes easily, so no worries about that. As well as, I can make the deadline task by task as your requirement.
Best regards
