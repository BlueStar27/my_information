Hello, I'm Vlad from Ukraine

The tech stack you described is exactly what I'm working on so I'd be glad to help you.

I am experienced Frontend developer with more than 6 years of Web development. I am proficient in React + Redux/MobX/Apollo but also have a lot of experience with different libs and frameworks that could match your requirements. In additional please check my LinkedIn page: https://kmpv.me/SwzKni

All the best,
Chris.

-Do you have any questions about the job description?

Do you have design ready? If not I'd like to mention that I'm a part of enthusiastic Ukrainian freelancers group experienced in Web development. If you need not Frontend work only we can take design prototyping or specific backend work as well. Where it supposed to be hosted? Do you need any help with domain, hosting once it's ready to be in prod?

-Do you have suggestions to make this project run successfully?

As for technology stack I'd suggest to use React (probably Gatsby) with Strapi.io CMS integration as an admin panel (it's written with a NodeJS). This will allow you to easily edit and maintain the website in future and/or find person to help you.

-What challenging part of this job are you most experienced in?

I don't see any challenges in here :)


-What part of this project most appeals to you?

React using react hooks I think & using of the docker.


-What past project or job have you had that is most like this one and why?

I think the most similar is this one but much more simpler â€“ http://mylastattempt.com/ It's also a simple band (rock band could be a company :) ) landing but client didn't want to apply any admin panel to it so it's simply react.
