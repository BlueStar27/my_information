I have quite a good experience with Reactjs. Understanding all the logic and the lifecycle of React makes me comfortable in developing applications in Reactjs.

Besides, I have a good understanding of Javascript ES6 features which is mostly used on React and I wanted to let you know I'm capable of handling any React code because I have from experience and intensive study acquired a deeper insight and understanding of how React works under the hood.

Before I dived into Reactjs I had a good foundation of javascript and had developed many applications with it, including javascript games, which led me to be super comfortable with the language.

I can confidently say that I have a great understanding in many of React's advanced and newest features, including the recently introduced state management system called Hooks. I have for instance worked on various applications with hooks as state management solution.

To conclude, I believe I am the right person for the job and I will gladly take any quizes or challenges you might have to prove myself as deserving enough to take the Job.
