-blockchain developer
Let me introduce myself.

During my career I have been done tens of projects and modules, and then experienced in frontend/backend development.
I can utilize popular frameworks such as ReactJs, VueJs, AngularJs, Laravel, NodeJs, GraphQl and extra so that I can make products qualified and paced up.
I realized the importance of blockchain technology and participated in development of smart contracts and NFT marketplaces, eventaully I developed two NFT marketplaces and several smart contracts for DAO.
So I ackquired ethereum related skills and I'm ambitious for other popular blockchain network skills.

I have been working as a software engineer for about 14 years now. I started my career as a web developer with php language about 9 years ago but my last 7 years are mostly involved with javascript frameworks and libraries like react.js angular and vuejs also nodejs and so on.
You know soft engineering is so much more than coding and I need to focus on different things like high level design and low level design, also creating blue prints and so on.
I love to contribute those kinds of works while working on projects.
I am familiar with angualr and while working with angular, I am familiar with angular js and angular both of them.
When we are talking about angular, angularjs means angular 1.x and angular means angular version 2 and more.
I am familar with with all of them and I was able to complete more than 20 small and large projects with enterprise solutions.
As a software engineer, I must be familiar with different services and tools, for the version controlling system, I am familiar with Github, BitBucket, Gitlab, Svn repositories, and also Microsoft Team services.
For the ticket management tools, I am familiar with Jira, Trello, active collab, Asana and you know there are many other services that we can use for the TMS purpose.
One of the most important things for the developers is testing. I am comfortable with unit testing, e2e testing of course automatic or the manual.
I can support more than 85% of code coverage for the codebase and cover the entire flow with e2e testing cases.
As a full stack developer, I am familiar with different backend frameworks and libraries,
I am familiar with expressjs and sailsjs  and node js.
For the Python language, I am comfortable with the django framework and also I have about 3 year of experience with Ruby on Rails as well.
For the database, personally I would like to use PostgreSQL for most of projects, I like it a lot.
Regarding my availablity, I can commit more than 40 ~ 50 hours a wekk, and I can commit at the weekend if needed.
I am an individual freelancer and I am flexible at working hours, I can be online any timezone and I will make more than 4~5 hours of overlapping time with you or other developers so we can keep communication clearly without any issues.

 From: Forever (MyoHyang/DESKTOP-R8FHHSA/192.168.108.141/Administrator-<a60a854c8a9f1505>)
  at Fri Aug 27 05:12:20 2021
-------------------------------------
I am Li Haoming and 27 years old.
I graduated from the several universities during 9 years. During that time, I had Bachelor of Science and Master of Computer Applications (MCA).
My major is Computer Science.
I have worked in some companies in many countries.
There, I worked as a Full-stack developer who designed database architecture and made the workflow.
I enjoy overcoming the challenges. 
Of course, until now, there were no special obstacles and challenges for me.
So I don’t know exactly how difficult it is to overcome challenges.
But I just want to improve my skills and tech skills by overcoming challenges.
Of course, now trying to get the job from your company is also another challenge for me.
But I will do my best to work with you.
And also I enjoy working with teamwork. I mean, I prioritize and value the team spirit as the most important thing.

I have worked in full stack engineering for my entire over 8 years career and my commitment to critical thinking and attention to detail have gotten me to where the frontend developer in IT Partner company.
I am a self-motivated, energetic collaborator who thrives on working in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines and have a desire to stay updated on current and new technologies.
So I have engaged as a role of leader in this company, contributing to make an innovative result and better progress. 

Due to pandemic, I had to end up my role in this company earlier, and now I am working as Frontend developer via Remote.
I have keen insight into what it takes to run a successful project because I have taken part in different successful projects across from startup to multi vendors.

My career goal is to have an opportunity to learn and grow my skills from a technical standpoint, and a chance to learn more skills over time. After reading the job description for this role, it sounds like this could be a good match for what I’m looking for.
I'd love to work for the company, innovative and ready to expand.
I think this company is exactly the one what I am looking for.


------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What interested you about our position?

I am interested in this job because I thought it has many things for me to do.Before facing this time, I had so many things to investigate.
First the roles of your company are React, React Native, Graphql.
I have rich experiences with those skills.
6 years React and React Native experiences and 5 years Angular experiences.
So I can complete any task that you give me and I can bring a lot of profit to your company.
Second, I guess there will be so many talented tech developers and engineers who have high skills and technologies. I just want to learn a lot from them and compare my skills with them.
Third, there will be great managers who have high skills and leadership including you.
In the past, I studied business once. I just want to learn a lot from you.
I mean if you accept me, I will do my best for you and me
I love working in a startup, Until now, I have worked in companies which have pretty been growing up and expanded, thus what I did in that role is kind of maintenance and tend to be passive in terms of creativity.
But this company has really much things valuable to do like Ronday Virtual Reality and I was so excited it is all what I would do.
I really want to contribute the prosperity and development of this company from starting point as one of pioneers.

--------------------------------------------------
2. what is your greatest achievement?

In my most recent role, I was responsible for managing the orientation and training programs for our new hires. Unfortunately, the content was not so good. While it was necessary information for our new hires to have, we found that only 40% of new hires did not complete the training. We were also receiving poor feedback on the course evaluation forms. I decided to rework the training program to make it more relevant and interesting, based on industry best practices and feedback on the evaluation forms. Today, 90% of participants complete the training and provide positive feedback about their experience. My manager was so pleased with the improvements that he asked me to lead a training seminar.


Final Round:
strengths and weaknesses, asking and answering questions, and personality and professionalism.

https://careersidekick.com/final-interview-questions/

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What are you passionate about?

My biggest passion is learning about software and technology. I was fascinated with computers from a young age,so I decided to study Computer Science in college and I’ve continued in that direction since graduating. It’s been a great choice for me! As a full stack software developer, I get to shape how the internet is progressing and how websites are evolving, and that’s exciting to me.

-----------------------------------------------
4. What motivates you?

What motivating me to choose a developer career was time to have an opportunity to read the
book "How to become a Genius".
I wanted to become Genius like others, and I have a role model in deep mind.
It was versatile according to specific events or stories that I have ever encountered.
Thus, they  sometimes became Neil Armstrong or Albert Einstein.
While reading this book, I was moved about the expression, "Where I am today is my starting
point. Who I am today is my starting point. My failures and successes of the past, my fears and
hopes of the future are all shadows. Today is my reality, and I’ll use it to create my world"
Based on this query, I reminded myself what my strength is and what to do.
That lead me to here, over 8  years of developer career.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
7.  What did you like most and least about your last job?

-Least

The company was growing quickly, so it was a bit disorganized and I often had multiple supervisors and senior team members giving me different instructions. However, I think this was a great opportunity to improve my ability to work under pressure and my communication skills. For example, I had to learn to communicate clearly and quickly to clarify with my managers and team if there was a conflict in what I had been asked to do. I enjoyed most aspects of the job and I ended up liking working in such a fast-paced environment in the end. It just took some adjustment. It was a great learning experience for me.

-Most

I love how the company offered learning opportunities and seemed to care about helping their employees develop and grow professionally. They had weekly lunch meetings where we’d learn a new topic, they offered tuition reimbursement, and all of the senior leadership team was very approachable and supportive.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

8. What sets you apart from other candidates?

I have a great willingness to learn. I think many prospects may expect to be hired for this position and not continue to cultivate their skills, but that is a priority.


-----------------------------------------------

9. Do you have other interviews happening?

Honestly, I’m interviewing with a few companies for a range of positions, but they all come down to delivering an excellent experience.
But this company is really valuable to work for me and great fit in my interest.
So I am really focusing on the interview with this company.


------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Do you want to tell us anything else about you?

I don’t have anything else to add. I feel like we covered the important topics, and I was able to share the key pieces of my background and how they’d help me perform well in the role. It was great learning about the role, 
[and the opportunity to do XYZ in this position sounds especially interesting.]


---------------------------------------------------------------
13. What is my strength and weakness?

- strength

As mentioned, I have experience working as a frontend, backend side and full-stack developer.
Of course, I don’t know exactly if this experience will be helpful  or not for your work.
However, in this period I have so many experiences in NodeJS, their frameworks or libraries including Nuxt, Next, React, Vue.
If you accept me, I will try to give you great satisfaction and success.
You probably will be satisfied.
There is one sample for you. You probably know or not about splitchek.com.
I attended the development of this site as project manager.
Last year we developed this site.
Of course, now this site is being modified and maintained. The frontends was developed with React and Backend side was developed with node js and GraphQL.
Anyway, I can cooperate and cowork with teammates because I had so many experiences as a project manager and Full-stack developer.


My strength is creativity and tenacity. Being able to gather client’s requirements and translate those into an engaging, effective and unique website is what has helped me obtain over 400 positive reviews.
I love failure, learn from failure and how to deal with failure next time.
thus being optimistic , never give up to realize dream.

- weakness

I always try to avoid confrontation, in both my personal and professional life. This caused me to compromise sometimes on the quality of my work or what I needed to complete a project just to keep the peace. This became a real problem when I became a manager. One of the most critical aspects of managing people is telling them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear. I recognized this weakness and had been actively working to voice my opinions constructively and helpfully for the betterment of the team.

10. What is your desired salary?

My current salary is $70,000, which is the maximum compensation that my employer allows for this position. As this job has a greater number of responsibilities, I'm seeking a 10% increase in my salary and asking for $80,000.

6. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years, I would like to become an engineering lead or team manager. As a web developer with your business, I know I would be able to take on a number of wide-ranging responsibilities related to the company’s web efforts. This would help me refine my knowledge of all areas of the company’s stack, which could then be applied in a managerial role further down the line.
