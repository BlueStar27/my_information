Hi, I have 4 years of experience in fronted development, worked in many technologies like React.js, Angular, Vue.js, Express.js, Sass, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Chart.js, D3.js, ECharts etc.
I have worked on more than 20 projects till now.

Hello, please take a look at previous works,
https://www.mwll.co.uk/
http://www.brandspay.com/
www.thedenimlab.com
https://affinitymedwear.com/
https://www.carparts.com/(React.js, PHP).
Through the development of whole project from scratch, My experience has become fulfilled with perfect usage of SASS,SCSS,lodash,graphQL,HOC and so on. 
I am also mastered Redux for state management of the mutable aps which are syncing with Rest API.
I have high attention to detail and deeply care about pixel-perfect, excellent UX/UI, and performance.
I am familiar with Node js program language including the usage of babel, lodash, socket.io, apiai packages and the process of building RESTful API,etc. 
As Mongodb is a non-relational database, developers need to think in a recursive way and concentrate on designing database structure.
If your project is a major one, I think it is important to design a database efficiently.
On the basis of requirments, I can estimate minimum time and make a bone for project as soon as possible.  
I will do my best to provide high-quality work if you hire myself.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Best Regards

Hello, I am .
I have ever used  fetch function for node.js and javascript in order to make hooli chatbot.
In my opinion, format of the authorization key is not proper.
In my case, no respone problem has been resolved by making async function to sync one applying await.
Or maybe overiding fetch functions could be problem.
I am confident to resolve such bug less that a day.
please hire me to fix those problem for you.
Best regards.
