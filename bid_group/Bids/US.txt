Hi, Martin.

I’ve worked on quite many projects that deal exactly with Laravel Authorization. 

Laravel is a elegent framework that provides a full web project base modules.

It's authorization contains two ways for authorization - gates and policy.

But as your desire, using gates is also a great way to implement authorization features.

I'd love to chat more about your project to make sure I'm the right persion for what you're looking for.

Hope to hear you soon. Thanks. Amin.

Dear, client. 
Really thanks for your detailed job posting and attached document.
I think you have a deep understanding of backend development,
	and it seems like you are just looking for someone who can share knowledge and skills with you.

*** Please check this: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F24AVicDRNtbyfUQyDn6bOdPgr9_h-bQ *** (You can see some forms that perform Ajax requests).

In my opinion, your project backend should be built with laravel as it supports Eloquent Relationship that can implement the ERM(Entiry Relationship Model) perfectly.
We can discuss more through chat. I think that could be a good experience for both you and me though if you don't hire me.

Thanks.
