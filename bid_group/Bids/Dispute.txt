Thank you.

23:08
Please elaborate as to why it's a fake project.

23:08
He asked to do his project and I accepted for his project.


23:10
But after that he had disappeared, in addition to that, he did not create any milestone. so i lose fee.


23:10
I want support to contact him to finish or refund my fee.


23:11
Thanks


23:11
First, please always keep in mind that a project fee will be charged upon accepting a project.

23:12
yes


23:13
Once you're awarded, we suggest not to accept it immediately as you have 36 hours to maximize to ask for the project details, to give time for the employer to create a pending payment and for you to review their profile page.

23:13
I am new in freelancer.


23:13
I understand that the employer is unresponsive; however, the project was only accepted yesterday.

23:13
I see.

23:13
Give your employer atleast 2 days more to respond.

23:13
okay


23:13
If not, contact us back again for help.

23:13
then I will bear for 2 days.
