Hi, there. I wish you are doing well. I think you would better use Python for web scraping.
I have vast experiences of scraping datas using BS4, Beautiful Soup, scrapy, selenium, requests, lxml and etc
First, I will make web scraper with python.
Second, I will Pick the urls from dataset of pdf or excel.
And then scrap the data from websites and export data to excel files.
I will do my best to satisfy you with the wonderful result.
