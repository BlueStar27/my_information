- Binding of UI elements to JavaScript object models

- Creating RESTful services with Node.js

- Architect scalable web architectures

- Work in a cross-functional team to deliver a complete user experience

- Create Unit and Integration tests to ensure the quality of code

- Be responsive to change requests and feature requests

- Write code that is cross-platform and cross-device compatible

- Ability to wear many hats and learn new technologies quickly

Let's meet in the chat room.
