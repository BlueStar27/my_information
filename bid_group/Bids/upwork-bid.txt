Hi there,

I would love to work with you and help you develop your website. If you need high quality and in-time delivery at an affordable price, I am the right developer for you.

As you can see in my Upwork profile, I have 5 years of total experience and more than 4 years with JS. I have developed dozens of projects with React/Node, including ibos.io, skeletonleaf.com.au and more. Now I'm available full time and can start immediately.

My rate is only $50 for projects like this one. I will deliver my work every day, you can check and review my work every day if you are interested. If this aligns with what you need, can we set up a time to discuss more further for this project?
