Hello.
I have read your requirements carefully. I can do any problem perfectly.

I am a senior C++, C#, Python developer.
I have 7+ years experience in C++, C#, Python.
Very familiar with algorithm and data structure, C++ STL.
And also rich experience in web scraping, API building using Python.

I'll do my best to complete your project perfectly.
I hope to discuss the project in more detail.
Thanks.
