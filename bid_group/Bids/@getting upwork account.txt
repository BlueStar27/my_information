Hi, Sir

Nice to meet you.

This is Lionel Jing from China.

As you can see, I am a professional web and mobile developer.

Here is a brief explanation about the job.

As a dedicated professional full-stack web and mobile app developer, I am working on Upwork a full-time position.

For now, I am going to extend my working field to Asia, Europe, Latin America.

Do you have an Upwork account?
If not, we can create a new account with your profile and I am using it remotely via Teamviewer.
You will be paid $0.2~0.5k+ in a month regularly.

All you need to do is just handle your PC (turn on the PC and TeamViewer app) so that I can access Upwork from your pc.

This is a really great and long-term opportunity, so I am looking for a reliable person who can work together.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you are interested.



Cheers
