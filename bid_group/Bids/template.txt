I am very happy when my client satisfies 100%.
Dear Client. How are you?
Your post caught my eyes so read it carefully. And I'm really interested and even excited about your project because your required skills really fit me.
I dare say I'm the best match for your project and I can do it perfectly.
To introduce myself, I'm a senior fullstack dev with over 11 years experience and my best skill is JS frameworks such as MERN/MEAN/MEVN. And I really really have much experience in third-party services such as AWS(lambda, dynamodb, s3...), firebase(social auth, push notification, real-time database), google maps and so on.. You know php/html/css/js are basic skills for a web dev and CI/Laravel is also what I'm very familiar with.
and then I have experiences of 5 YEARS with WORDPRESS.
I have also lived with Android/mobile for 3 years.
No need to talk much, right?
Let me show you some of my past works and want your advice.
